## Manipulating the Thread Signal Mask
When a new thread is created, it inherits a copy of the signal mask of the thread that created it. A thread can use pthread_sigmask() to change its signal mask, to retrieve the existing mask, or both.
```
#include <signal.h>
int pthread_sigmask(int how, const sigset_t *set, sigset_t *oldset);
//Returns 0 on success, or a positive error number on error
```

## Sending a Signal to a Thread
```
#include <signal.h>
int pthread_kill(pthread_t thread, int sig);
//Returns 0 on success, or a positive error number on error
```
