# 6\. Joining with a terminated thread

The *pthread_join()* function waits for the thread identified by thread to terminate. (If that thread has already terminated, pthread_join() returns immediately.) This operation is termed joining.

```
#include <pthread.h>
int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **retval); //retval is a double pointer . observe  carefully.
//Returns 0 on success, or a positive error number on error
```

this 'retval' recieves a copy of the return value of the terminated thread.
