# 7. Detaching a thread

By default, a thread is joinable, meaning that when it terminates, another thread can obtain its return status using pthread_join().
Sometimes, we don’t care about the thread’s return status; we simply want the system to automatically clean up and remove the thread when it terminates. In this case, we can mark the thread as detached, by making a call to *pthread_detach()* specifying the thread’s identifier in thread.


If a thread is not detached , then we must join with it using pthread_join(). If we fail to do this, then, when the thread terminates, it produces the thread equivalent of a zombie process.

```
#include <pthread.h>
int pthread_detach(pthread_t thread);
//Returns 0 on success, or a positive error number on error
```

Once a thread has been detached, it is no longer possible to use pthread_join() to obtain its return status, and the thread can’t be made joinable again. 
Detaching a thread doesn’t make it immune to a call to exit() in another thread or a return in the main thread. In such an event, all threads in the process are immediately terminated, regardless of whether they are joinable or detached. 
To put things another way, pthread_detach() simply controls what happens after a thread terminates, not how or when it terminates.
