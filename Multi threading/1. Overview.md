# **Multi threading**

## **1\. Overview**

Multi threading is a way in which we can write programs that run concurrently.  
why we use multi threading when we have *fork()* system calls?  
the answer is that when we use fork() system call, a child process is created, but we still has two problems and those are

1.  Any type of Inter process Communication (such as `pipes` ) is required to communicate the changed data between the parent and the child.
2.  Process creation with fork is expensive. That is it has to copy a lot of values like page tables and file descriptor tables etc.

besides these, threads share some common data that include

- Process ID
- Parent ID
- controlling terminal
- process credentials (users and groups)
- open file descriptors
- record locks created using `fcntl()`      .... and many more


Apart from that threads has data that is thread specific like

- thread ID
- signal mask
- thread specific data
- alternate signal stack
- the *errno* variable      etc
