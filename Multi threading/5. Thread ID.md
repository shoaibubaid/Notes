Each thread within a process is uniquely identified by a thread ID.

This ID is returned to the caller of *pthread_create()*,

and a thread can obtain its own ID usingÂ  *pthread_self()*.

```
#include <pthread.h>
pthread_t pthread_self(void);
//Returns the thread ID of the calling thread
```

various pthread functions need the thread id to identify the thread upon which they are going to act. some of the functions like

*pthread_join(), 
pthread_detach(),
pthread_cancel(), 
pthread_kill(),*

sometimes it is better to use the pthread_equal() function sor keeping the thread data opaque.

```
#include <pthread.h>
int pthread_equal(pthread_t t1, pthread_t t2);
//Returns nonzero value if t1 and t2 are equal, otherwise 0
```
