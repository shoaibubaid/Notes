# 4\. Thread termination

Thread is terminated when one of the following events occur.

1.  The thread' s start function performs a return specifying a return value for the thread.
2.  The thread calls *pthread_exit()* function
3.  the thread is cancelled using *pthread_cancel()*
4.  Any of the threads call *exit()* or the main thread *return*

The pthread_exit() function terminates the calling thread, and specifies a return  
value that can be obtained in another thread by calling pthread_join().

```
include <pthread.h>
void pthread_exit(void *retval);
```

The *retval* argument specifies the return value for the thread. The value pointed  
to by *retval* should not be located on the threadâ€™s stack, since the contents of that  
stack become undefined on thread termination.
