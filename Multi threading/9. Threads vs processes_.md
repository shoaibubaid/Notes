# Threads vs processes:

### Advantages of multi threaded approach:

- Sharing data between threads is easy. By contrast, sharing data between processes  
    requires more work (e.g., creating a shared memory segment or using a pipe)
- Thread creation is faster than process creation; context-switch time may be  
    lower for threads than for processes.

### disadvantages of multi threaded approach

- unlike as in multi process programming, when programming with threads, we need to ensure that the functions we call are thread-safe or are called in a thread-safe manner.
- A bug in one thread (e.g., modifying memory via an incorrect pointer) can damage all of the threads in the process, since they share the same address space and other attributes. By contrast, processes are more isolated from one another.
