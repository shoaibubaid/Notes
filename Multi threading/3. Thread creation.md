# 3\. thread creation

When a program is started, the process consists of a single thread, called the initial or the main thread. Now in this section we will see how to create a additional threads.

the *pthread_create( )* function creates a new thread

```
#include <pthread.h>
int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread,  const pthread_attr_t *attr, void *(* start)(void *),void *arg);
//Returns 0 on success, or a positive error number on error
```

as we can see

- we specify the thread id's pointer ,
- thread attribute pointer which is by default NULL
- start is the function which we want the thread to execute
- and arg is the argument that we want to give to the start function

this pthread_create() function returns 0 on success, or a positive error number on error
