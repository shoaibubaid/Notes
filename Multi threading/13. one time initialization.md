# 13. one time initialization

## Thread safe functions:

a function is said to be ***thread-safe*** if it can safely be invoked by multiple threads at the same time.  
put conversely, if a function is ***not** thread-safe*, then we can’t call it from one thread while it is being executed in another thread.

some functions inherently are thread safe  
for eg,

```c
int add(int a, int b){ 
    return (a+b); 
}
```

as there are no local or global variables involved , this function is thread safe.

Sometimes, a threaded application needs to ensure that some initialization action occurs just once, regardless of how many threads are created. For example, a mutex may need to be initialized with special attributes using pthread_mutex_init(), and that initialization must occur just once.

## One-Time Initialization
```
#include <pthread.h>
int pthread_once(pthread_once_t *once_control, void (*init)(void));
//Returns 0 on success, or a positive error number on error


pthread_once_t once_var = PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT;
```

The first call to pthread_once() that specifies a pointer to a particular pthread_once_t variable modifies the value of the variable pointed to by once_control so that subsequent calls to pthread_once() don’t invoke init. One common use of pthread_once() is in conjunction with thread-specific data, which we describe next.

simply put, the pthread once looks at the state of the once control, if the state is not modified yet, it modifies the state and runs the init function.
