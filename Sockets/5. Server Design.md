The recv() and send() system calls perform I/O on connected sockets. They provide
socket-specific functionality that is not available with the traditional read() and
write() system calls.

```c
#include <sys/socket.h>
ssize_t recv(int sockfd, void *buffer, size_t length, int flags);
//Returns number of bytes received, 0 on EOF, or –1 on error
ssize_t send(int sockfd, const void *buffer, size_t length, int flags);
//Returns number of bytes sent, or –1 on error
```
