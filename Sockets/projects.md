1. Basic Socket Programming

Exercise: Implement a simple TCP server and client in C++. The server should listen for incoming connections, accept them, and echo back any messages received from the client.
Key Concepts: Sockets, TCP/IP, blocking I/O, error handling.
2. UDP Communication

Exercise: Create a UDP client and server that can send and receive messages. The server should handle multiple clients simultaneously.
Key Concepts: UDP sockets, non-blocking I/O, packet loss handling.
3. Client-Server Model

Exercise: Design a basic client-server architecture for a multiplayer game where clients can send player actions to the server, and the server broadcasts the updated game state to all clients.
Key Concepts: Game state management, serialization of data, network latency handling.
4. Serialization

Exercise: Write a function to serialize and deserialize a custom game object (e.g., a player or an item) for transmission over the network.
Key Concepts: Data formats, protocol design, efficient data transfer.
5. Handling Latency and Packet Loss

Exercise: Discuss or implement strategies to handle latency and packet loss in a real-time multiplayer game. This could involve techniques like client-side prediction and interpolation.
Key Concepts: Network latency, packet acknowledgment, state reconciliation.
6. Threading and Asynchronous I/O

Exercise: Modify your TCP server to handle incoming connections using threads or asynchronous I/O. Ensure thread safety when accessing shared resources.
Key Concepts: Concurrency, mutexes, condition variables, thread pools.
7. Network Protocols

Exercise: Design a simple custom protocol for a multiplayer game that includes commands like "MOVE", "ATTACK", and "DISCONNECT". Implement parsing for this protocol.
Key Concepts: Protocol design, state machines, command patterns.
8. Security Considerations

Exercise: Discuss potential security vulnerabilities in networked games (e.g., cheating, DDoS attacks) and suggest ways to mitigate them.
Key Concepts: Encryption, validation of input, anti-cheat mechanisms.
9. Real-Time Data Updates

Exercise: Implement a system that allows the server to push real-time updates to clients (e.g., position updates for moving players).
Key Concepts: Publish/subscribe model, efficient data broadcasting.
10. Testing and Debugging

Exercise: Write tests for your networking code to ensure robustness under various conditions (e.g., simulating packet loss, high latency).
Key Concepts: Unit testing, mock objects, integration testing.
