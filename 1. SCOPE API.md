# Scope

The scope object is used to control the capture or the glitch portion of the chipwhisperer device.

To create a scope object, use chipwhisperer.scope() function.

```python
import chipwhisperer as cw
scope = cw.scope()
```

This will connect to chipwhisperer and return a scope object of correct type.

```python****
scope(scope_type=None, name=None, sn=None, idProduct=None, bitstream=None, force=False, prog_speed=10000000, **kwargs) chipwhisperer.scope()
```

==**Note:** None of the parameters are compulsory, Don't touch unless required.==  
The parameters are:

- **scope_type:** scope type to connect to. options are OpenADC, CWNano. If nothing is mentioned, automatically detects the type of CW connected. use like this cw.scopes.OpenADC . for more details use *print(dir(cw.scopes)*
- **name:** This is mainly required when you have multiple chipwhisperers, all of different types are connected. valid values Nano, Lite, Pro, Husky. defaults to None
- **sn:** This is also used mainly when you have multiple chipwhisperers connected. Defaults to None. This is the serial number of the CW you want to connect to.
- **idProduct:** : Also used when multiple CW are connected. Alternative to specifying the serial number. Defaults to None. Valid values are :0xace0: CW-Nano, 0xace2: CW-Lite, 0xace3: CW-Pro, 0xace5: CW-Husky.
- **bitstream:** path to bitstream to program. If None, programs to default bitstream.
- **force:** If True, always erase and program FPGA. If False, only erase and program FPGA if it is currently blank. Defaults to False. Ignored on Nano.
- **prog_speed:** Sets the FPGA programming speed for Lite, Pro, and Husky. If you get programming errors, try turning this down.
- **kwargs:** Allows passing additional keyword arguments for further customization.

There are currently two types of scopes.

- OpenADC scope (Lite, Pro, Husky)
- Chipwhisperer Nano scope ( Nano)

We are going to discuss only the former. The outline is given below

## 1\. OpenADC scope

So, what exactly is this OpenADC?

ADC means Analog to Digital Converter.

OpenADC is an open-source, high-speed Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) **module** specifically designed for side-channel analysis and embedded security research. It was created as part of the ChipWhisperer hardware and software framework, which is widely used for performing side-channel attacks like power analysis and fault injection on embedded systems, cryptographic devices, and microcontrollers.

**Hardware Module**: OpenADC itself is a physical ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) module that captures signals, typically connected to a target device whose power usage or behavior you want to monitor.

we control this OpenADC module through the given APIs.

Here is How the OpenADC class looks like:  
out of which those which are bold are of our interest.

- class OpenADC
    - **enter**
    - **exit**
    - **init**
    - **repr**
    - **setattr**
    - **str**
    - \_capture_read
    - \_dict_repr
    - \_getCWType
    - \_getFWPy
    - \_getNAEUSB
    - \_get_usart
    - adc_test
    - add_read_only
    - **arm**
    - **capture**
    - **capture_segmented**
    - **cglitch_setup**
    - check_feature
    - **con**
    - dcmTimeout
    - **default_setup**
    - **dis**
    - disable_newattr
    - disable_strict_newattr
    - enable_MPSSE
    - enable_newattr
    - feature_list
    - finish_mpsse_setup
    - fpga_reg_read
    - fpga_reg_write
    - getCurrentScope
    - getLastTrace
    - **get_last_trace**
    - **get_last_trace_segmented**
    - **get_name**
    - get_serial_ports
    - **glitch_disable**
    - **reload_fpga**
    - remove_read_only
    - reset_fpga
    - reset_sam3u
    - setCurrentScope
    - upgrade_firmware
    - **vglitch_setup**

Note: once a scope object (of OpenADC) is created, we use every method in the format of scope.method(). so for eg, arm() means scope.arm()

1.  **arm():** sets up the scope to begin capturing or glitching when triggered. **(Is this the trigger itself??????????)**  
    The scope must be armed before capture or glitching (when set to ‘ext_single’) can begin.
2.  **capture():** Captures trace. Scope must be armed before capturing.  
    Blocks until scope triggered (or times out), then disarms scope and copies data back.  
    Read captured data out with **scope.get_last_trace()**
3.  **capture_segmented():** \[Not relevant for Lite users yet\] Captures trace in segment mode, returns as many segments as buffer holds.  
    Timeouts not handled yet properly (function will lock). Be sure you are generating enough triggers for segmented mode.
4.  **cglitch_setup(default_setup=True):** one of the important methods for us. Sets up sane defaults for **clock** glitching. we will discuss about these features in the later discussion.
    - glitch clk_src = clkgen
    - output = clock_xor
    - trigger_src = ext_single
    - hs2 = glitch
    - LP and HP glitch disabled
5.  **con(sn=None, idProduct=None, bitstream=None, force=False, prog_speed=10000000.0, \*\*kwargs):** Connects to attached chipwhisperer hardware. (**I think the one with which we are connecting is the DUT**????)  
    Not relevant if we don't have extra CW for target.
    - sn (str) – The serial number of the attached device. Does not need to be specified unless there are multiple devices attached.
    - idProduct (int) – The product ID of the ChipWhisperer. If None, auto detects product ID. Optional.
    - bitstream (str) – Path to bitstream to program. If None, programs default bitstream. Optional.
    - force (bool) – Force reprogramming of bitstream. If False, only program bitstream if no bitstream is currently programmed. Optional.
6.  **default_setup(verbose=True, sleep=0.2):** the one above *cglitch_setup()* is especially for clock glitching.  
    this one for ***capture defaults***
    - 25dB gain
    - 5000 capture samples
    - 0 sample offset
    - rising edge trigger
    - 7.37MHz clock output on hs2
    - 4\*7.37MHz ADC clock
    - tio1 = serial rx
    - tio2 = serial tx
    - tio4 = highZ
    - CDC settings change off
7.  **dis():** Disconnects the current scope object.
8.  **get_last_trace(as_int=False):**
9.  **get_last_trace_segmented():**
10. **get_name():**
11. **glitch_disable():**
12. **reload_fpga(bitstream=None, reconnect=True, prog_speed=1000000.0):** Not relevant for us yet.
13. **vglitch_setup(glitcht, default_setup=True):**  
    Sets up sane defaults for **voltage** glitch
    - glitch clk_src = clkgen
    - output = glitch_only
    - trigger_src = ext_single
    - hs2 = clkgen
    - LP glitch if glitcht = ‘lp’ or ‘both’
    - HP glitch if glitcht = ‘hp’ or ‘both’

* * *

one by one details of the above features are mentioned in the later discussions.

* * *

We have seen some of the features of the scope object.  
lets look at the other properties under it one by one in detail.

* * *

## 1.1 scope.gain

The class to control the gain settings is named GainSettings  
here is the outline of that class

- class **GainSettings**(oaiface, adc)
    - property **mode**: str
    - property **gain**: int
    - property **db**: float

so, if we want to access gain, we simply use scope.gain.db

**mode:**  *\[depreciated/ ignore\]* The current mode of the LNA. The LNA can operate in two modes: low-gain or high-gain. Generally, the high-gain setting is better to use.  
==Note that this value will be automatically updated if the dB gain is set.==

**gain:** *\[depreciated/ ignore\]* The current LNA (Low Noise Amplifier) gain setting. This gain is a dimensionless number in the range \[0, 78\]. Higher value causes higher gain in dB.  
==Note that this function is unnecessary - the dB gain can be set directly. This property is only here to help convert old scripts.==

**db:** The gain of the ChipWhisperer’s low-noise amplifier in dB. Ranges from ***\-6.5 dB to 56 dB***, depending on the amplifier settings.

```
# reading and storing
gain_db = scope.gain.db

# setting
scope.gain.db = 20
```

example is given below

- gain =
    - mode = low
    - gain = 0
    - db = 5.5

* * *

## 1.2 scope.adc

Class to control non-gain, non-clock ADC settings

- class **TriggerSettings**(oaiface)
    - property **state**
    - property **basic_mode**: str
    - property **timeout**
    - property **offset**
    - property **presamples**
    - property **samples**
    - property **decimate**
    - property **trig_count**: int
    - property **fifo_fill_mode**: str

lets go through one by one

**state:** The current state of the trigger input. This is a digital value (i.e.: high or low), which is some combination of the pins in the triggermux object. **Read-only**, so we cant do much about it. (A trigger input is typically a digital or analog signal that indicates when a particular action should occur. It can be a pulse, a level change, or a specific condition that causes a system to respond.)

**basic_mode:** The type of event to use as a trigger. Only applies to the ADC capture - the glitch module is always a rising edge trigger.the valid values are \[“low”,"high","rising_edge","falling_edge"\]

**timeout:** The number of **seconds** to wait before aborting a capture. If no trigger event is detected before this time limit is up, the capture fails and no data is returned.

**offset:** The number of samples to wait before recording data after seeing a trigger event.  
This offset is useful for long operations. For instance, if an encryption is 1 million samples long, it’s difficult to capture the entire power trace, but an offset can be used to skip to the end of the encryption.  
The offset must be a 32 bit unsigned integer.

**presamples:** The number of samples to record from before the trigger event.  
This setting must be a positive integer, and it cannot be larger than the number of samples. When streaming mode is enabled, this value is set to 0.

**samples:** The number of ADC samples to record in a single capture.  
The maximum number of samples is hardware-dependent: - cwlite: 24400

**decimate:** The ADC downsampling factor.  
This value instructs the ChipWhisperer to only record 1 sample in every &lt;decimate&gt;. In other words, if this value is set to 10, the sampling rate is set to 1/10th of the sampling clock.  
This setting is helpful for recording very long operations or for reducing the sampling rate for streaming mode.

**trig_coutn:** The number of samples where the trigger input was active.  
This value indicates how long the trigger was high or low last time a trace was captured. It is the number of samples where the input was low (in “low” or “falling edge” modes) or high (in “high” or “rising edge” modes). **Read-only.**  
This counter is not meaningful if the trigger is still active

**fifo_fill_mode:** \[you can ignore this\] The ADC buffer fill strategy - allows segmented usage for CW-lite and CW-pro.  
==Warning: THIS REQUIRES NEW FPGA BITSTREAM - NOT YET IN THE PYTHON.==  
Only the ‘Normal’ mode is well supported, the other modes can be used carefully.

here is an example of how the adc properties looks

- adc =
    - state = False
    - basic_mode = low
    - timeout = 2
    - offset = 0
    - presamples = 0
    - samples = 24400
    - decimate = 1
    - trig_count = 3188812138
    - fifo_fill_mode = normal

## 1.3 scope.clock

class to control the adc or target clocks .

- class **ClockSettings**(oaiface, hwinfo=None, is_husky=False):
    - property **adc_src**: str
    - property **adc_phase**: int
    - property **adc_freq**: int --- ***Read-only.***
    - property **adc_rate**: int --- ***Read-only.***
    - property **adc_locked**: bool --- ***Read-only.***
    - property **freq_ctr**: int --- ***Read-only.***
    - property **freq_ctr_src**: str
    - property **clkgen_src**: str
    - property **extclk_freq**: int
    - property **clkgen_mul**: int
    - property **clkgen_div**: int
    - property **clkgen_freq**: str
    - property **clkgen_locked**: bool

![b7cf6ffe09afbeb904881c81044e9795.png](../_resources/b7cf6ffe09afbeb904881c81044e9795.png)  
Lets look at each of the parameter closely now.

**1\. adc_src:** The clock source for the ADC module. The ADC can be clocked by one of five possible sources:

- “clkgen_x1”: CLKGEN output via DCM (Digital Clock Manager)
- “clkgen_x4”: CLKGEN output via DCM with x4 clk multiplier
- “extclk_x1”: External clock input via DCM
- “extclk_x4”: External clock input via DCM with x4 clk multiplier
- “extclk_dir”: External clock input with no DCM

**2\. adc_phase**: Fine adjustment for the ADC sampling point. This setting moves the sampling point approximately 5 ns forward or backward, regardless of the sampling frequency. It may be helpful to improve the stability of the measurement.

**3\. adc_freq**: ***Read-only.*** The current frequency of the ADC clock in Hz.  
This clock frequency is derived from one of the ADC clock sources as described in ***adc_src.***

**4\. adc_rate**: ***Read-only.*** The current sampling rate of the ADC clock in samples/s. Note that the sampling rate may be less than the clock frequency if the downsampling factor is greater than 1.

**5\. adc_locked**: ***Read-only*** The current status of the ADC DCM. .  
To try re-locking the ADC, see reset_adc().

**6\. freq_ctr**: ***Read-only*** The current frequency at the frequency counter in Hz.  
The frequency counter can be used to check the speed of the CLKGEN output or the EXTCLK input. This value shows the current frequency reading.

**7\. freq_ctr_src**: The current input to the frequency counter. (**why are we using this?????**)  
There are two possible inputs to the frequency counter: - “clkgen”: The CLKGEN DCM output - “extclk”: The external input clock signal

**8\. clkgen_src**: The input source for the CLKGEN DCM.  
This DCM can receive input from one of two places:

- “extclk”: The external clock input.
- “system” or “internal”: The system clock (96 MHz).

**9\. extclk_freq**: The input frequency from the EXTCLK source in Hz.

This value is used to help calculate the correct CLKGEN settings to obtain a desired output frequency when using EXTCLK as CLKGEN input. It is not a frequency counter - it is only helpful if the EXTCLK frequency is already known.

**10\. clkgen_mul**: The multiplier in the CLKGEN DCM. This multiplier must be in the range \[2, 256\].

**11\. clkgen_div**: The divider in the CLKGEN DCM. This divider must be in the range \[1, 256\].

**12\. clkgen_freq**: The CLKGEN output frequency in Hz.  
The CLKGEN module takes the input source and multiplies/divides it to get a faster or slower clock as desired. Minimum clock in practice is 3.2MHz.

**13\. clkgen_locked**: **Read-only.**.The current status of the CLKGEN DCM.

- clock =
    - adc_src = clkgen_x1
    - adc_phase = 0
    - adc_freq = 374988281
    - adc_rate = 374988281.0
    - adc_locked = True
    - freq_ctr = 0
    - freq_ctr_src = extclk
    - clkgen_src = system
    - extclk_freq = 10000000
    - clkgen_mul = 2
    - clkgen_div = 1
    - clkgen_freq = 192000000.0
    - clkgen_locked = True

**tio1:** The function of the Target IO1 pin. TIO1 can be used for the following functions:

- “serial_rx”: UART input
- “serial_tx”: UART output
- “high_z” / None: High impedance input
- “gpio_low” / False: Driven output: logic 0
- “gpio_high” / True: Driven output: logic 1

Default value is “high_z”. Typically, this pin is used as a trigger input.

**pdid:** The state of the PDID pin. same like pdic.

**pdic:** The function of the PDIC pin output pin. This is a GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output) pin. The following values are allowed:

- “high” / True: logic 1
- “low” / False: logic 0
- “disabled” / “default” / “high_z” / None: undriven

**nrst:** The state of the NRST pin. See pdic for more information. See also nrst_drive_poweroff for behaviour with target_pwr.

**glitch_hp:** Whether the high-power crowbar MOSFET is enabled. The glitch output is an SMA-connected output line that is normally connected to a target’s power rails. If this setting is enabled, a high-powered MOSFET shorts the power-rail to ground when the glitch module’s output is active.

> ==Warning==
> 
> ==Use with caution - ensure that the glitch module is properly configured before enabling this setting, as it is possible to permanently damage hardware with this output.==

**glitch_lp:**  Whether the low-power crowbar MOSFET is enabled. This is the low-power version of glitch_hp - see that documentation for more details.

> ==Warning==
> 
> ==Use with caution - ensure that the glitch module is properly configured before enabling this setting, as it is possible to permanently damage hardware with this output.==

**extclk_src:** The clock signal being used as input for EXTCLK. Currently, this can only be HS1, which is the clock from the target. As such, this value is read-only.

**hs2:** The clock signal routed to the HS2 high speed output pin.Allowed clock signals are:

- “clkgen”: The output from the CLKGEN module
- “glitch”: The output from the glitch module
- “disabled” / None: No clock; output driven low

**target_pwr:** Whether the target board is powered by the ChipWhisperer.

If True, the ChipWhisperer is currently supplying power to the target board; if False, it is not. This setting can be used to cycle power to the target or to help program it.

If the target board is powered through an external supply, this setting may have no effect.

**tio_states:** Reads the logic level of the TIO pins (1-4) and returns them as a tuple of the logic levels.

**cdc_settings:** Check or set whether USART settings can be changed via the USB CDC connection. i.e. whether you can change USART settings (baud rate, 8n1) via a serial client like PuTTY

an example looks something like

- io =
    - tio1 = serial_tx
    - tio2 = serial_rx
    - tio3 = high_z
    - tio4 = high_z
    - pdid = high_z
    - pdic = high_z

## 1.5 scope.trigger

- class **TriggerSettings**(cwextra)
    - property **triggers:** The trigger module in use.The trigger modules available depend on the hardware. On the CWLite, only the basic trigger module can be used.  
        Available trigger modules:
        - ‘basic’: Trigger on a logic level or edge
    - property **module:** The logical input into the trigger module.The trigger module uses some combination of the scope’s I/O pins to produce a single value, which it uses for edge/level detection or UART triggers. This trigger output can combine 5 pins using one of 3 different boolean operations. N/A for ‘trace’ trigger module (see scope.trace.trace_mode for how to connect trace pins.)
    - Pins:
        - tio1-4: Target I/O pins 1-4. Note that these pins can be in any mode.
        - nRST: Target I/O pin nRST. Note that these pins can be in any mode.
        - sma: An auxiliary SMA input, if available (only on CW1200)
    - allowed boolean operations:
        - OR
        - AND
        - NAND  
            ==Note that only one boolean operation can be used over all input pins.==
    - Examples of acceptable trigger inputs:  
        \- “tio1”  
        \- “tio3 OR tio4”

Now lets have a closer look one by one.

**clk_src** : The clock signal that the glitch DCM is using as input. This DCM can be clocked from three different sources:

- “target”: The HS1 clock from the target device (can also be AUX clock for Husky)
- “clkgen”: The CLKGEN DCM output (N/A for Husky)

**width** : The width of a single glitch pulse. For CW-lite and CW-pro, width is expressed as a percentage of one period. One pulse can range from -49.8% to roughly 49.8% of a period. The system may not be reliable at 0%. Note that negative widths are allowed; these act as if they are positive widths on the other half of the clock cycle.

**width_fine** : The fine adjustment value on the glitch width. N/A for Husky.  
This is a dimensionless number that makes small adjustments to the glitch pulses’ width. Valid range is \[-255, 255\].  
Note: this value is **WRITE-ONLY** (yes, Write only)

**offset** : The offset from a rising clock edge to a glitch pulse rising edge.  
For CW-lite and CW-pro, offset is expressed as a percentage of one period. A pulse may begin anywhere from -49.8% to 49.8% away from a rising edge, allowing glitches to be swept over the entire clock cycle.

==**WARNING:** very large negative offset <-45 may result in double glitches (CW-lite/pro only).==

**offset_fine** :The fine adjustment value on the glitch offset. N/A for Husky.  
This is a dimensionless number that makes small adjustments to the glitch pulses’ offset. Valid range is \[-255, 255\].

**trigger_src** : The trigger signal for the glitch pulses.  
The glitch module can use four different types of triggers:

- “**continuous**”: Constantly trigger glitches.  
    The following scope.glitch parameters have no bearing (not relevant) in this mode: ext_offset, repeat, num_glitches.
    
- “**manual**”: Only trigger glitches by calling manual_trigger().  
    The following scope.glitch parameters have no bearing (not relevant) in this mode: ext_offset, num_glitches. In this mode, calling scope.arm() will trigger a glitch as well.
    
- “**ext_single**”: Use the trigger module.  
    Once the scope is armed, one set of glitch events is emitted when the trigger condition is satisfied. Subsequent trigger conditions are ignored unless the scope is re-armed.
    
- “**ext_continuous**”: Use the trigger module.  
    A set of glitch events is emitted each time the trigger condition is satisfied, whether or not the scope is armed.
    

**arm_timing** : When to arm the glitch in single-shot mode. If the glitch module is in “ext_single” trigger mode, it must be armed when the scope is armed. There are two timings for this event:

- “no_glitch”: The glitch module is not armed. Gives a moderate speedup to capture.
- “before_scope”: The glitch module is armed first.
- “after_scope”: The scope is armed first. This is the default.

This setting may be helpful if trigger events are happening very early. If the glitch module is not in external trigger single-shot mode, this setting has no effect.

**ext_offset** : How long the glitch module waits between a trigger and a glitch.  
After the glitch module is triggered, it waits for a number of clock cycles before generating glitch pulses. This delay allows the glitch to be inserted at a precise moment during the target’s execution to glitch specific instructions.

For CW-Lite/Pro, scope.glitch.num_glitches is not supported so this is a simply an integer.

**repeat** : The number of glitch pulses to generate per trigger. When the glitch module is triggered, it produces a number of pulses that can be combined with the clock signal. This setting allows for the glitch module to produce stronger glitches (especially during voltage glitching). For CW-Lite/Pro, scope.glitch.num_glitches is not supported so this is a simply an integer.  
Has no effect when trigger_src = ‘continuous’. Repeat counter must be in the range \[1, 8192\].

**output** : The type of output produced by the glitch module. There are 5 ways that the glitch module can combine the clock with its glitch pulses:

- “clock_only”: Output only the original input clock.
- “glitch_only”: Output only the glitch pulses - do not use the clock.
- “clock_or”: Output is high if either the clock or glitch are high.
- “clock_xor”: Output is high if clock and glitch are different.
- “enable_only”: Output is high for glitch.repeat cycles.

Some of these settings are only useful in certain scenarios:

- Clock glitching: “clock_or” or “clock_xor”
- Voltage glitching: “glitch_only” or “enable_only”

This is an example of how the module looks like

- glitch =
    - clk_src = target
    - width = 10.15625
    - width_fine = 0
    - offset = 10.15625
    - offset_fine = 0
    - trigger_src = manual
    - arm_timing = after_scope
    - ext_offset = 0
    - repeat = 1
    - output = clock_xor
